# Welcome to Fermat!

In the last 20 years virtually everything went digital: pictures, music, videos, mails, etc. Nevertheless we still have cash as paper money. 

#### Why isn't cash money digital yet?

The reason is that digital information can be cloned, and if digital cash could be cloned it would render it useless. When bitcoin was invented it brought with it the solution to the last barrier preventing money from going digital: the solution to the _double spend problem_.

We firmly believe that the next decade will witness governments issuing digital currency based on blockchain technology. We expect paper money is going to disappear within the next 5 to 10 years. Thus a strong consumer demand for digital wallets will inevitably emerge.

In order to meet this demand thousands of wallets should be available. Wallets will evolve into sophisticated financial applications. Such a wide variety of wallets / financial applications are indispensable owing to the diversity characterizing the world's population and its financial needs. In fact most of current mobile APPs will turn into financial APPs once Fermat provides them with the ability to easily handle digital cash and digital assets. 

#### The Master Plan

Fermat is a master plan to avoid getting into that future by waiting for independent entrepreneurs to build each of these wallets and financial apps one at the time and from scratch, repeating every time all the math, accounting, cryptography and algorithms that are common to all these APPs. Fermat handles all that and by doing the heavy lifting enables any developer in the world to easily create niche wallets and financial APPs on top of its shared infrastructure.

Fermat offers a new approach, allowing us to achieve large-scale and systematic cooperation in an entirely distributed and decentralized manner. Our goal is to move from competition to cooperation by creating the infraestructure needed to decentralize not only software development, but also analysis and design. 

#### The Framework

Fermat is a p2p financial application framework that enables any kind of trust-less applications, including digital wallets. 

The framework evolves from the stand-alone crypto wallet and enables an ecosystem of peer-to-peer financial applications that are both crypto currency and digital asset enabled. The Framework handles a full stack of layers. Starting down from an OS API level, to a Blockchain, Communication, Platform, and User Interface Level.

#### The Network

Crypto networks are peer-to-Peer electronic cash systems that allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Stand-alone crypto wallets stay truth to that principle. But the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to transport metadata, synchronize devices, hold wallet files or keys, manage identities, interface crypto networks or the legacy financial system.

Fermat features a peer-to-peer network for transporting metadata and interconnect network clients between each other. On top of that network a synchronization scheme transforms a standalone app into a distributed application across several devices still owned by the same user.

#### Fermat Goals

* To allow people with no developing knowledge to build their own desktop and mobile peer-to-peer financial applications in a similar way a non-developer builds a **Wordpress** site: reusing Plug-ins and _themes_. 

* To act as a local back-end not only for native-Fermat-APPs and wallets, but also for any other mobile app.

* To be a full-stack Framework in the development of financial applications making them unbannable, reliable and not easy to hack as they are fully decentralized. 


#### Open Source

The challenge is truly colossal, but we know that the difference between the possible and impossible lies in a team's determination. We have the will to transcend and to spread our vision for this world.

We have the talent, motivation and determination required to create the next generation of financial applications. These will allow people to manage their own digital wallets in a secure way enabling them to interact using their funds in a wide array of transactions and business oriented opportunities across the globe.

We believe the open source community collectively has more influence than any of us individually. Therefore for us it is important to acknowledge and revere services where others invested their time and efforts in order to build. We believe in decentralization.

#### Developer Network

We are asking each of you to help lead the way. Because we’re already connected with you as we are also developers and designers, and we want to build our relationship with you into a network of developers across the world to share new ideas and forge new collaborations. Working together, we can build the tools and technology that people need to become financially independent, have access from any country to financial products and be safe of nasty third parties spying on them or trying to tell them what they can and can not do with their money. We believe in true financial freedom.

We want to hear from you on how we can build this network. We are by now about 50 developers / designers / academics / entrepreneurs working full time on Fermat and our goal is to reach 500. To learn more about how to join, just read the [how-to-participate-guide](https://github.com/bitDubai/participate-now). We hope at every single one of you will join us.  Because Fermat and the world need you.  We need your skills, imagination and optimism.  And with this new network, we're sure we can be partners for decades to come.

We believe in people with passion who are crazy enough to think they can change the world. With a lot of hard work, we believe we can accomplish this.

We won't stop until we do it.

<br>
## The Challenge

While designing Fermat we tried to find the answer to the following questions:

* How can we build a P2P network to interconnect all devices between each other in a scalable way?
* How do we get sure the communication is secure?
* How do we build a Plug-ins Framework able to run on smart phones?
* How do we make as much of the code portable to other every OS?
* How do we enable thousands of developers to collaborate?
* How do me make the framework multi-wallet or multi-app?
* How do we let the End User to install more wallets within the same APP and in a P2P way?
* How do we organize Plug-in in order to be reusable by other Plugin?
* How do we prevent a bad Plug-in from stealing the digital funds stored on other Plug-ins?
* How do we make sure information keeps a consistent state even if a phone turns itself off at any time?
* How can we manage multiple identities used by the End User on different wallets / APPs?
* How can we isolate ordinary people from the perceived complexity of crypto currencies?
* How do we integrate merchants, retailers and brands of all sizes in a clever way?
* How can we allow non-developers to create digital wallets without programming anything at all?
* How can we create a fair systems with the developers who contribute to the project?
* How can we use the collective intelligence of the developer community?
* How can we reuse the entire current infrastructure already in place?


The answers to each of these questions are addressed within Fermat.

<br>
## What is Fermat?

Fermat is a system where we experiment on what needs to be done for the masses to adopt crypto currencies. As it is very easy to develop mobile APPs on Fermat, entrepreneurs can use it to easily test their business models.

Technically Fermat is an open-source P2P system built on a Plug-in architecture that handles a stack of platforms and runs on multiple OS including Android, Linux, iOS, OSX and Windows.

#### What makes Fermat different from other wallet systems or services?

* **Fermat is P2P.** This makes it censorship resistant and difficult to hack.

* **Fermat is built with Plug-ins.** This enables it to be reused and for any developer to engage.

* **Fermat runs on end users' devices.** This enables users to manage their own money eliminating the need to trust a third party.

* **Fermat is inclusive.** By creating their own Plug-ins, current industry members can integrate with Fermat to offer their services and products to Fermat's already user base.

* **Fermat segments the world population and offers a custom tailored solution for each segment.** Any developer can easily create niche wallets for a particular group of people, for example Brands creating their own wallets for their customers. All the heavy lifting is done by the Fermat underlaying technology.

* **Fermat guarantees Plug-ins and wallet developers a revenue stream.** Fermat implements an innovative business model which allows plugins and wallet developers to define a use license, and Fermat itself enforces this license on behalf of developers.

Fermat is moving towards version 1, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our
[white paper](FERMAT-WHITE-PAPER.md) that we're anxious to add. So take Fermat out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite platform to launch your own digital wallet or financial APP.
